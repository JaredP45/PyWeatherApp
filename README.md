## Python Weather App
Author: Jared Paubel

This is my individual project for the capstone course at Butler Community College. My key goals for this project include:
* Use API calls to pull in weather information and display within the app which also updates after a set interval.
* Use Tkinter to develop the GUI and practice general user interface practices.
* Separate the various functionalities into different files and use OOP to better organize the program.
